# Google OAuth Email Verification

## Overview

When users sign in with Google OAuth, their emails are automatically considered verified since Google has already verified them. This document explains how email verification works for different authentication methods.

## How Email Verification Works

### Google OAuth Users
- **Automatic Verification**: When users sign in with Google, their email is automatically marked as verified
- **Organization Creation**: An organization is automatically created for them
- **Immediate Access**: Users can immediately use all features without needing to verify their email

### Email/Password Registration
- **Manual Verification Required**: Users who register with email/password must verify their email
- **Verification Email**: They receive an email with a verification link
- **Access**: Full system access is granted after email verification

### Magic Link Sign-in
- **Pre-verified**: Users signing in with magic links are considered verified
- **No Additional Steps**: The act of clicking the magic link verifies ownership of the email

## Current System Behavior

The system **does NOT block** users from logging in based on email verification status. The `emailVerified` field is used for:
- Display purposes in the admin dashboard (showing a verified badge)
- Preventing duplicate verification emails
- Analytics and user management

## Fixing Existing Users

If you have Google OAuth users with unverified emails (from before this fix), run the following script:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/olmo9/Desktop/Taskmanager

# Run the fix script
npx tsx scripts/fix-google-oauth-emails.ts
```

This script will:
1. Find all Google OAuth users with unverified emails
2. Mark their emails as verified
3. Report the number of users updated

## Admin Capabilities

Admins can manually verify any user's email through the admin dashboard:
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Find the user in the Users section
3. Click "Verify Email" if the email is unverified

## Technical Details

The email verification is handled in the NextAuth configuration (`/lib/auth.ts`):
- The `signIn` callback checks for Google OAuth providers
- For existing users signing in with Google, it ensures `emailVerified` is set
- For new Google OAuth users, the Prisma adapter automatically sets `emailVerified`
- A safety check runs 1 second after sign-in to ensure verification is set

## Security Considerations

While Google OAuth users are automatically verified, the system still maintains security through:
- Organization-based task isolation
- Allowed emails list for task creation via email
- API key authentication for programmatic access
- Session-based authentication for web access

## Troubleshooting

### User Shows as Unverified in Admin Panel
Run the fix script mentioned above or manually verify through the admin panel.

### User Can't Create Tasks via Email
Check if their email is in the organization's allowed emails list. Google OAuth verification doesn't automatically add them to the allowed list.

### Organization Not Created for Google User
This should happen automatically in the JWT callback. Check the server logs for any errors during the sign-in process.
