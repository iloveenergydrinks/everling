# Task Assignment & Visibility System - Complete ✅

## What We Built

We've implemented a comprehensive task visibility and assignment system that transforms your platform from "everyone sees everything" to "see only what's relevant to you".

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Task Visibility Levels
- **Private** (default): Only the creator can see
- **Assigned**: Creator and assignee can see  
- **Shared**: Specific people can see (via @mentions)
- **Team**: Everyone in organization can see

### 2. Email Pattern Detection
The system automatically detects visibility from email patterns:
- `[TEAM]` in subject → Team task
- `[PRIVATE]` in subject → Private task  
- `@mentions` → Shared/Assigned task
- No mentions → Private task

### 3. Assignment Detection
Multiple ways to assign tasks:
- `@john` - Mention in subject or body
- `assign to: email@example.com` - Explicit assignment
- `delegate to bob` - Delegation language
- `for alice` or `-> alice` - Assignment patterns

### 4. Dashboard Filters
New filter tabs in the UI:
- **All My Tasks** - Everything you can see
- **Assigned to Me** - Tasks others gave you
- **Created by Me** - Tasks you created
- **Shared with Me** - Tasks you're mentioned in
- **Team Tasks** - Organization-wide tasks

### 5. Database Changes
- Added `visibility` field to Task model
- Added `sharedWith` array for multiple people access
- All existing tasks defaulted to 'private' for safety
- Indexes added for efficient querying

## How It Works

### Sending an Email
```
To: acme@everling.io
Subject: Review report @alice @bob
Body: Please review the Q4 report

Result:
- Task created with visibility: 'shared'  
- Alice is assignee (first mention)
- Bob is in sharedWith array
- Sender can see it
- Others cannot see it
```

### Privacy Examples
```
"Schedule therapy" → Private (only sender sees)
"[TEAM] Office closed" → Team (everyone sees)
"Fix bug @john" → Assigned (john and sender see)
"Meeting @alice @bob" → Shared (alice, bob, sender see)
```

## Files Modified
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added visibility fields
- `/lib/task-visibility.ts` - Core visibility logic
- `/lib/email.ts` - Updated email processing
- `/app/api/tasks/route.ts` - Visibility filtering
- `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added filter tabs

## Migration Status
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ All existing tasks set to 'private' visibility
- ✅ API respects visibility rules
- ✅ UI shows filter tabs
- ✅ Email processing detects patterns

## Privacy Impact
**Before**: All organization members could see ALL tasks
**After**: Members only see:
- Tasks they created
- Tasks assigned to them
- Tasks they're mentioned in  
- Tasks marked as [TEAM]

This is a **major privacy improvement** that allows teams to use the same organization while keeping personal tasks private.

## Next Steps
1. Test with real users in different organizations
2. Add ability to change visibility after task creation
3. Add notification when someone assigns you a task
4. Improve @mention resolution with nicknames
5. Add bulk visibility change for existing tasks

## Important Notes
- The system defaults to PRIVATE for safety
- Organization admins cannot see private tasks of other members
- Email deduplication is tenant-specific (per organization)
- Multiple assignees are supported via sharedWith array

The platform is now ready for teams where members want both collaboration AND privacy!
